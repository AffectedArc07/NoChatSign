# NoChatSign

Simple bukkit plugin that cancels the regular chat event and send all chat messages as system messages.

## About

With the advent of chat signing and player reporting in 1.19, there is a demand for servers with unsigned messages so you can moderate your own server without a megacorporation staring down over you. This plugin cancels regular chat messages and sends them as system messages instead, removing the signatures from it.

This plugin does not support custom chat formats. It will break them.
